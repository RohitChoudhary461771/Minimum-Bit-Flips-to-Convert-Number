Example 1:

Input: start = 10, goal = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
- Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.
It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

class Solution {
    public int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
     if(start==goal)return 0;

     int ans=start^goal;
    //  int n=Integer.bitCount(ans);(using library function)

    //By looping counting number of high bits.
    int n=0;
    while(ans!=0){
        if((ans & 1)==1){
            n++;
        }
        ans=ans>>1;
    }
     return n;   
    }
